# Stora Junior Developer Coding Challenge 

How to get the project running;
Once the repo is cloned and you have navigated to the directory, use cmd 'rails server' to start the server listening on port 3000. Open http://localhost:3000 on a browser and the project will be running.

Plan to approach problem;
Initally got familiar with Rails and began thinking about the table design for Units and Bookings. My plan was to focus on functionality and leave design for any extra time I had (which ended up being 0).

If I had more time;

* Thorough testing 
* Comments added
* More validation 
* Actual styling - make it less painful to look at
